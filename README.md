# :package: Cloudwatch-alarm-to-slack-python
Send AWS Cloudwatch Alarm to Slack using AWS Lambda.

# Configurations

## → Lambda Configs
Clone the repository, go to repository folder and use following commands to create lambda package:
```
pip install requests -t ./
chmod -R 755 .
zip -r ../myDeploymentPackage.zip .
```
Note: We have do this because we're using 3rd party package "requests" which doesn't come with python lambda runtime. So we have to include it in our package.

2. Go to slack workspace settings and setup incoming webhook.
